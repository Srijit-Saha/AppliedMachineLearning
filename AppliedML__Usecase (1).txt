Constraints

Final State

Qualitative
Too Many Fraud cases
=> Low Customer
Investment Sentiment
=> Lower Cash flow +
Direct Revenue losses
through Fraud =>
Lower Bank revenue
Build a model that can
spot fraud cases
efficiently within a
short span of the
fraudulent transaction
Decrease Fraud Cases
=> Improve Customer
Sentiment => Higher
Cash flow => Improve
revenue
FP – Normal Bank
transactions
misidentified as
fraudulent => doesn’t
affect user experience
much => no significant
impact on revenue
FN – Fraud remains
undetected => Low
user trust => Loss in
bank revenue
TP – Fraudulent cases
detected => Higher
Bank reliability =>
more Cash flows =>
Higher Bank Revenue
TN - Normal
transactions classified
as non-fraud =>
maintained bank user
experience => No
significant impact
Can afford a very small
percent of FN => Small
percentage of loss in
cash flow => Limited
loss in revenue.
Benefits: significantly
lesser fraud =>

Quantitative
5% Fraud Cases => 810% decrease in cash
flow + 2% direct
loss(depending on
fraud size) => 12-15%
loss in revenue
Reduce fraud cases by
60% (5% to 2%) => 6%
increase in cash flow =>
9% increase in revenue

What is the
current problems
we are facing in
the initial state,
and why do we
need to rectify
them.
What is it that we
are doing and
why? (Improve
Bank Revenue in
this case)

What are the cost,
benefits of correct
predictions and
why?

1% TP => 0.5% increase
in cash flow => 0.5%
revenue increase
1% FP => -.05% cash
flow due to customer
harassment causing
decline in user
experience => -.1% loss
in bank revenue
1% FN => 0.6% risk of
direct lump sum loss
=>4% cash flow loss =>
7% loss in revenue
1% TN => no significant
impact on bank.
At most 5% FN => 3%
risk of lump sum loss
=> acceptable for 9%
increase in revenue.
At least 60% decrease
in Fraud cases

What are the
acceptable risk
margins and why?

What is the
desired outcome

Significantly better
user experience =>
Generates more
circular cash flow =>
More bank revenue
Costs:- Cant allow too
many FN’s => limited
risk of direct loss + loss
through lower
customer sentiment =>
limited loss in revenue

At most 5% FN allowed
=> 3% of risk of lump
sum loss => 5% risk in
revenue loss.
